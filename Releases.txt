"HEAD"
The head of all development branches. You always get the latest version, but it might be unstable.
Do not use for production servers!
Rerunning the install script will update the existing installation to the current HEAD version.

Tagged releases:
The tagged releases consist of a set of sub package releases which are known to work together.

"00.16.00"
Features:
- QtHardMon 00.09.00
-- Automatic conversion for fixed point value.
   Floating point values are displayed and can be input.
-- dmap file can be loaded as command line argument

"00.15.00"
Features:
- MtcaMappedDevice 00.12.00
-- Support for the upciedev driver
- CommandLineTools 00.01.01

"00.14.00"
Features:
- MtcaMappedDevice 00.11.00
-- Complete test suite (almost 100 % code coverage)
- MotorDriverCard 00.04.00
-- Config calculators which produce XML motor configurations
   from the motor parameters (command line and Qt version)
-- Improved config for the VT21 stepper motor
Bug fixes:
- MtcaMappedDevice
-- relative and absolute pathes of dmap and map files are now working
- MotorDriverCard
-- Fixed typo in a parameter name (acceleration was written with two 'l's)
Attention: The old config files need to be updated.
The parser is throwing an exception:
"Found old, invalid Register name maximumAccelleration. Please update your config file!"
This is done to prevent this parameter from being ignored if the config
is not updated.

"00.13.00"
Features:
- MotorDriverCard 00.03.00
-- New high level classes StepperMotor and LinearStepperMotor
-- SPI handshake (requires firmware 2.2)

"00.12.00"
Features:
- MtcaMappedDevice 00.10.00 provides automatic fixed type conversion.
- QtHardMon upgrade from 00.05.01 to 00.08.00
-- Added hex value display. No input in hex possible at the moment.
-- Implemented DMA read (from bar 0xD)
-- Introduced open/close button for device.
-- Background of modified fields is changing to red
-- Several bug fixes

"00.11.00"
-- Increased MtcaMappedDevice to 00.09.00. It does not contain any new feature,
   but has bug fixes which are is incompatible to 00.07.00.
   Thus a new, consistent version of MTCA4U.

"00.10.00"
- moved all classes in MtcaMappedDevice into the mtca4u namespace
- removed the 'convenince' include of the MtcaMappedDevice subdirectory
  from the MtcaMappedDevice_INCLUDE_FLAGS. Together with the namespace
  it allows the parallel use of UTCApcie and mtca4u.
Attention: This finally breaks the backward compatibility to the original
library. You have to change e.g. '#include <devPCIE.h>' to
'#include <MtcaMappedDevice/devPCIE.h' and add the mtca4u namespace.

"00.09.02"
- fixed dependency in debian control file

"00.09.01"
fixed dependency problem of debian develeopment package

"00.09.00"
Features:
- License changed to GPL 3+
- Started to implement unit tests
- MtcaMappedDevice: devPcie now supports llrfuni and pciedev drivers
- QtHardMon: font size change and read on click in the register list
- New package: MotorDriverCard
