This is a short step-by-step guide which does not give much background information. It refers to other documents for further reading.

Components
Driver: pcieuni
C++ user space library: deviceaccess
Language bindings for deviceaccess: CommandLineTools, PythonBindings, MatLab
GUI: QtHardMon

Installation:
Driver:
- Download the latest tags of gpcieuni and pcieuni from https://svnsrv.desy.de/public/mtca4u/drivers/
  You need both. pcieuni is a modular driver which is based on gpcieuni, so you have to intall the latter first.
  To find the latest tag number run svn ls.
$ svn ls https://svnsrv.desy.de/public/mtca4u/drivers/gpcieuni/tags
  0.1.0/
  0.1.1/
$ svn co https://svnsrv.desy.de/public/mtca4u/drivers/gpcieuni/tags/0.1.1 gpcieuni_0.1.1

- Install it by running 'make install'. You need the C-compiler and the headers for the kernel, as well as the DKMS package
  (dynamic kernel managenemt support) from you linux distrubution to be installed.
$ cd gpcieuni_0.1.1
$ sudo make install

User space components (all the rest):
There in an installer which you can download from  https://svnsrv.desy.de/public/mtca4u/mtca4u_installer.

- Pick the latest tag and download it
$ svn ls https://svnsrv.desy.de/public/mtca4u/mtca4u_installer/tags
  ...
  0.16.1/
$ svn co https://svnsrv.desy.de/public/mtca4u/drivers/mtca4u_installer/tags/01.02.00 mtca4u_installer_01.02.00

- Read the Manual.txt file and install all required dependencies with your package manager
- You will have to "set(INSTALL_PUGIXML true)" in CMakeLists.txt or alternatively have to modify the selection of MTCA4U sub-packages and remove MotorDriverCard
  (see "Expert installation" at the end of the Manual.txt for the latter).
- Go to the installer directory and call the install script
$ cd mtca4u_installer_01.02.00
$ ./install.sh

- Read the QtHardMon User Guide https://svnsrv.desy.de/public/mtca4u/QtHardMon/trunk/doc/user_guide/QtHardMon_user_guide.pdf
  or ~/mtca4u/01.02.00/share/doc/QtHardMon/QtHardMon_user_guide.pdf
  (Adapt the version number accordingly. You should have received a map file together with your firmware)
  Run ~/mtca4u/01.02.00/bin/QtHardMon
- To write a C++ application have a look at the deviceaccess Doxygen documentation under
  ~/mtca4u/01.02.00/share/doc/mtca4u-deviceaccess-00.07/html (or wherever you installed it. Adapt the versions numbers in the path.)
  and read "Adapting your Makefile" in ReadME.DOOCS.txt in the installer source directory.
  If you are using CMake, set CMAKE_MODULE_PATH=~/mtca4u/01.02.00/share/cmake-[MAJOR].[MINOR]/Modules (adapt cmakes major and minor version number in the path).
